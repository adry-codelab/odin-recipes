Project Introduction and Skills Reflection
The current project focuses on building a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS , the core languages used for structuring and styling web pages. Through this project, I am creating a responsive, visually appealing website that incorporates essential elements such as headers, navigation menus, images, buttons, and layouts. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in writing semantic HTML code and applying CSS techniques like flexbox, grid systems, and media queries to ensure the design adapts seamlessly across different devices.

Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

HTML Structure : Writing clean, semantic markup to organize content effectively.
CSS Styling : Applying styles to enhance the visual appeal of the website while maintaining consistency.

As a self-reflection at the end of the project, I can confidently say that mastering these skills has deepened my understanding of front-end development fundamentals. By combining creativity with technical knowledge, I’ve gained hands-on experience in crafting user-friendly interfaces—a critical step toward becoming proficient in web development.

This project not only solidifies my grasp of HTML and CSS but also lays the groundwork for exploring more advanced technologies like JavaScript, frameworks, and backend integration in future endeavors.
